Unit 04 Web APIs Homework: Code Quiz

This was a timer-base quiz application that stores high scores client-side.

How to Play:

User arrives to the landing page and is presented with a "Start Quiz" button.
Once the "Start Quiz" button is hit, the user is presented with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with 60 seconds and immediately begins countdown.

The score is calculated by time remaining. Answering incorrectly results in a 10 second time penalty.

When time runs out or all the questions have been answered, the user is presented with the final score and is asked to enter their initials. The final score and user initial are then stored in the local storage.
